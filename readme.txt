May the force be with you....

-->To Run this just open CMD and navigate its way to this directory....and type command- "node app.js" in the machine where node js is installed....and it'll open the webapp in localhost port:4000, Displaying the homepage of the app..

-->So in this project i have done every thing from the scratch, Writing the HTML pages and the node.js project creating the database everything. I Used Postgres DB to save and iterate through data. 

-->The Home-Page, So i have designed the home page keeping the theme monochrome (and that looks sick to me) there is a menu at top which can be seen or hidden by a click. There is a list in homepage having the clickables links so to direct get to pages like: Add,Delete,Search,Update....And the home page is responsive no matter the screen size you can see a beautiful UI, have handeled  using @media query...

-->Initiated my node.js project.....Am using Express to route the paths.

-->Made other pages like to show the phonebook,Add contact etc.. and routed them all using express.

-->Using a "POST" Method to send the details from the add page to the app.js page to save them to the database.

-->So there have been some change(not the happy ones..), I have connected my database with the project... its showing the rows and the data of all contact but dont know some how the data is not being saved in DB.

-->TIME IS RUNNIG OUT Made a "Under-Construction" html page and coneected it to all the incomplete links..

-->The project is incomplete as of 29/05/2020 10:37 and making a final commit in git.

-->I Tried So Hard....And I Think I Got So Far...But In The End It Doesn't Even Matters..

P.s. Thanks Rentmojo for giving this oppurtunity...No seriously....it's the first project in which I have dedcated myself so much.. I have done with the feeling that it'll made it's way to production. I know it's not completed but I am happy and satisfied with the project(it's like zero tohero for me..) and I think with some more time it'll be up and running.....I think I should have done this project using Django maybe??
